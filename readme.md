Reggie! Level Editor ("Reggie-Updated" fork)
============================================

Advanced level editor for New Super Mario Bros. Wii, created by Treeki and
Tempus using Python, PyQt and Wii.py.

The "Reggie-Updated" fork aims to keep Reggie! compatible with the latest versions of its
dependencies, and to fix bugs and make minor improvements. Pull requests that make large
changes to how the editor works or add major features will be declined — please make your
own fork for that.
